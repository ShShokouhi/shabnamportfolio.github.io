                    <h2> BALADA: An Electric Motorcycle Prototype </h2>
                </header>
                <p> Introducing BALADA, our groundbreaking electric motorcycle prototype, inspired by the Persian word
                    for a thoroughbred horse—a true symbol of speed and elegance. This project was the brainchild of a
                    dynamic team of student engineers to compete in a nationwide machine design competition,  where it proudly secured second place. My role in
                    this project focused on the design and optimization of the chassis. My responsibilities included 3D
                    modeling and stress analysis to ensure the structure was both efficient and robust.

                <p>I developed he 3D model of BALADA’s chassis in SolidWorks, selecting materials considering weight, strength, cost, and
                    availability. I then used ADAMS to simulate the chassis under various conditions—including static,
                    acceleration, and braking—with two passengers, each weighing an average of 70 kg, to predict the
                    loads it would face. Following this, I conducted stress analysis in SolidWorks Simulation, which
                    revealed a minimum safety factor of 1.7.</p>
