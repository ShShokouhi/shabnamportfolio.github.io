                <p> I'm from Iran, where the oil and gas industry is huge. As a mechanical engineer, I had the
                    opportunity to intern and work at top engineering design firms in the oil, gas, and petrochemical
                    sectors. Right after earning my B.Sc., I interned at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pidec/"> 
                        PIDEC</a></a>, a leading consulting firm, where I
                    gained hands-on experience in engineering design, technical drawing, and documentation. I worked
                    closely with the mechanical team on 3D CAD models and P&ID designs, and I even got to visit an
                    under-construction plant we were consulting on.</p>

                <p> After completing my M.Sc. and before moving to Australia, I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer
                    at <a href=" https://www.linkedin.com/company/siraf-refineries-infrastrucre-co-/"> Siraf SRIC </a></a>. I delivered 3D CAD and CAM models, engineering drawings, and documentation for
                    numerous components and assemblies, and I also handled risk assessments on rotary equipment. It was
                    a great experience, though I can't share more details due to confidentiality agreements.
